%    Pstar          [double]     k*k matrix of

%
% OUTPUTS
%    lnpriormom     [double]     scalar of log endogenous prior value

% Code to implement notes on endogenous priors by Lawrence Christiano,
% specified in the appendix of:
% Introducing Financial Frictions and Unemployment into a Small Open Economy Model
% by Lawrence J. Christiano, Mathias Trabandt and Karl Walentin (2011), Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control
% this is the 'mother' of the priors on the model parameters.
% the priors include a metric across some choosen moments of the (supposedly
% pre-sample) data.
% *** Implemented file for variances, but in principle any moment
% *** could be matched
% As a default, the prior second moments are computed from the same sample
% used to find the posterior mode. This could be changed by making the
% appropriate adjustment to the following code.

% Finally, we have the sampling uncertainty measure Shat:
