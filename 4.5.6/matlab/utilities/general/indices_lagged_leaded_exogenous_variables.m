function [il,l1,ik,k1] = indices_lagged_leaded_exogenous_variables(k,M)
% returns indices of all endogenous variables split between auxiliary
% variables for lagged or leaded exogenous variables and all other ones
%
% INPUT
% k: vector of endogenous variables ID
% M: model structure
%
% OUTPUT
% il: indices of lagged or leaded variable in vector k
% l1: value of lagged or leaded variable in vector k
% ik: indices of non lagged or leaded variable in vector k
% k1: value of non lagged or leaded variable in vector k
